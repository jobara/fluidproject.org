The Fluid community is pleased to announce the release of Infusion 2.0!

Infusion 2.0 includes significant framework improvements and _is not backwards compatible_ with previous versions of Infusion. Please see [API Changes from 1.5 to 2.0](http://docs.fluidproject.org/infusion/development/APIChangesFrom1_5To2_0.html) and [Deprecations in 1.5](http://docs.fluidproject.org/infusion/development/DeprecationsIn1_5.html) on the [Infusion Documentation](https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion-docs) site.

[Release Notes](https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion/blob/infusion-2.0/ReleaseNotes.md)

## What's New in 2.0.0?
- Constraint-based priorities, supported by `listeners`, `modelListeners`, `modelRelay`, `distributeOptions`, `contextAwareness`, and `components`. This allows the specific order of those items to be configured. (See: [Priorities](http://docs.fluidproject.org/infusion/development/Priorities.html))
- Context Awareness - and things it relies on:
  - Global Instantiator
    - Every Infusion component, regardless of how it is instantiated, ends up in a single-rooted tree of components
    - This enables use of modern IoC features such as model relay and declarative event binding
    - Enables use of the root distributeOptions context "/"
    - Enables the removal of "demands blocks"
    - Useful debugging tip: Watch `fluid.globalInstantiator` in your JS debugging tools to see the structure of your application and its tree.
- `fluid.notImplemented` function for implementing abstract grades
- [Lazy loading for UI Options](http://docs.fluidproject.org/infusion/development/UserInterfaceOptionsAPI.html#lazyload) and instructions for how to use the Preferences Framework with a [zero initial load time](http://docs.fluidproject.org/infusion/development/tutorial-prefsFrameworkMinimalFootprint/MinimalFootprint.html).
  - This should assist in improving performance when using the Preferences Framework, particularly for resource intensive sites and applications
- Much faster invokers and boiled listeners (c. 60x faster)
- Support for using Infusion with npm for both Node.js and web-based projects.
  - Provides a variety of prebuilt versions of Infusion in the module's `dist` directory.
- Source Maps are generated for the concatenated JavaScript files
- View oriented IoC debugging tools
  - Including FluidViewDebugging.js on the page of any Infusion application gives you access to the _IoC View Inspector_. Click on the small cogwheel icon at the bottom right of the page to open a panel which shows the details of the view components and their grades, that are attached to DOM nodes in the browser pane. This interface works similarly to the _DOM Inspector_ familiar from modern web browsers, but is an experimental implementation with an engineer-level UI.
